# TypeScript Type Coercion Runtime Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in TypeScript where type coercion can lead to unexpected runtime errors.  The `bug.ts` file shows code that compiles successfully but throws an error when executed because of incorrect type usage.  The `bugSolution.ts` file demonstrates how to resolve this by adding stricter type checking.
